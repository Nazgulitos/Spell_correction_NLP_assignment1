The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n\nThe best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n\nWhen solving this task, we expect you'll face (and successfully deal with) some problems or make up the ideas of the model improvement. Some of them are: \n\n- solving a problem of n-grams frequencies storing for a large corpus;\n- taking into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings;\n- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster;\n- ...\n\nPlease don't forget to describe such cases, and what you decided to do with them, in the Justification section.\n\n##### IMPORTANT:  \nYour project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere.

This allows the model to consider the surrounding words when making corrections, which is crucial for context-sensitive spelling correction.\n- The n-gram frequencies are loaded from the provided dataset (`bigrams.txt` and `fivegrams.txt`), which ensures that the model is trained on a large and diverse corpus.\n\n#### Edit Distance with Keyboard Neighbors:\n- The Levenshtein distance is modified to account for **keyboard typos**. By assigning a lower cost (0.5) to substitutions involving adjacent keys on a QWERTY keyboard, the model is more forgiving of common typing errors.\n- This feature helps the model prioritize corrections that are more likely to be actual typos (e.g., \"dking\" â†’ \"doing\" or \"dying\").\n\n#### Semantic Similarity with SpaCy Embeddings:\n- The solution incorporates **SpaCy word embeddings** to measure semantic similarity between words. This helps the model choose corrections that are not only contextually appropriate but also semantically coherent.\n- For example, in the phrase \"dking species,\" the model correctly identifies \"dying\" as the most appropriate correction because it aligns semantically with \"species.\"\n\n#### Candidate Generation and Ranking:\n- The model generates candidate corrections by considering words within an edit distance of 2 and ranks them based on a combination of **n-gram frequency**, **edit distance penalty**, and **semantic similarity**.\n- This multi-faceted approach ensures that the most probable correction is selected, balancing context, frequency, and meaning.\n\n#### Efficiency Improvements:\n- The n-gram frequencies are moved to the GPU using **PyTorch** to speed up computations. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces the time required for probability calculations.\n- The use of **defaultdict** for storing n-gram frequencies also helps in efficiently managing memory and access times.\n\n### Problems and how the solution resolved them:\n\n#### Large N-gram Dataset:\n- Storing and processing large n-gram datasets can be computationally expensive. To address this, the solution uses **GPU acceleration** with PyTorch to speed up the computation of n-gram probabilities.\n- Additionally, the use of **defaultdict** ensures that only relevant n-grams are stored, reducing memory overhead.\n\n#### Out-of-Vocabulary Words:\n- The model handles out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words by generating candidate corrections based on edit distance and semantic similarity. If a word is not found in the dictionary, the model still attempts to correct it by considering nearby words in the embedding space.\n- This approach ensures that the model can handle rare or misspelled words effectively.\n\n#### Keyboard Layout and Typos:\n- The solution incorporates a **keyboard neighbor mapping** to account for common typing errors. By assigning a lower cost to substitutions involving adjacent keys, the model is better equipped to handle real-world typos.\n- This feature is particularly useful for correcting words like \"dking\" to \"doing\" or \"dying,\" depending on the context.\n\n#### Semantic Coherence:\n- To ensure that corrections are not only contextually but also semantically appropriate, the solution uses **SpaCy embeddings** to measure word similarity. This helps the model choose corrections that make sense in the given context.\n- For example, in the phrase \"dking species,\" the model correctly identifies \"dying\" as the most appropriate correction because it aligns semantically with \"species.\"\n\n### Comparison of Norvig solution with Custom one:\n\n#### Custom Corrector:\n- The custom corrector achieves an accuracy of **46.15%** on the test set. While this is lower than Norvig's corrector, it demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating **contextual information** (via n-grams) and **semantic similarity** (via SpaCy embeddings).\n- The custom corrector is particularly strong in handling **context-sensitive corrections**, such as distinguishing between \"dking sport\" and \"dking species.\" It also performs well in correcting **keyboard typos** due to the modified edit distance algorithm.\n\n#### Norvig's Corrector:\n- Norvig's corrector achieves a higher accuracy of **61.54%** on the test set. This is expected, as Norvig's solution is a well-established and highly optimized spell-checking algorithm.\n- However, Norvig's corrector lacks the **contextual awareness** and **semantic understanding** of the custom solution. For example, it fails to correct \"dking sport\" to \"doing sport\" or \"dking species\" to \"dying species,\" as it does not consider the surrounding words or semantic coherence.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Useful resources (also included in the archive in moodle):\n\n1.
